## Outline & Goals

1. Simulation for statistical reasoning
2. Samples vs. populations
3. Sampling distributions
    - realization vs. expectation
    - standard deviation vs. standard error
4. Sources of sampling bias
    - sample / population mismatch
    - response bias
5. Declaring populations and sampling in code (R)


## Simulation for statistical reasoning

- One of the best ways to gain an intuition about populations, samples, bias, etc. is to simulate data and examine its properties
  + By simulating data, you are also forced to be explicit about the assumptions in your measurement approach
  + By working with simulated data, you also have the chance to try out different approach to analysis
  + This is especially important with *prospective evaluations*, where designs are put forward to collect data before it is available
  
- We're going to simulate data and sampling designs in *R*.

## R Preliminaries

Make sure your R and RStudio are up-to-date. Then install the required packages.

```{r install, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
install.packages("DeclareDesign", "ggplot2")
```

Load the required packages.

```{r load, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}
library(DeclareDesign)
library(knitr)
library(ggplot2)
library(grid) # plot diff types of data together
library(gridExtra)
library(dplyr)
library(kableExtra)
```

## Toy example w/ single item

Carbon footprint of Santa Barbara county households:

  - declare_population() allows you to declare the assumed characteristics of the population that you want to study.

```{r sb-population, echo=TRUE, message=F, eval=TRUE, cache=TRUE}
set.seed(228) # so everyone gets the same results

#36000 people, random uniform draw from min of 5 to 120 tons carbon equialent. dataframe with 36000 rows, varaible called households that's an id form 1-36000, and observations of tons carbon equivalent
population <- declare_population(
  households = add_level(N=36000, 
     tco2e=runif(n=N, min=5, max=120))
)
pop <- population()
plot <- ggplot(pop, aes(x=tco2e)) + 
  geom_histogram(color="black", fill="white")
plot
```

## Toy example w/ single item

```{r sb-population2, echo=FALSE, message=F, eval=TRUE}
plot
```

## Drawing a sample

```{r sb-sample, echo=TRUE, message=F, eval=TRUE}

sam <- sample(1:36000,2000) #vector of 2000 values, coressponding to data frame we created

#add original historgram and look at how sample compares
plot2 <- ggplot(pop, aes(x=tco2e)) + 
  geom_histogram(color="black", fill="white") +
  geom_histogram(data=pop[sam,], fill = "black")

plot2
```

## Drawing a sample

```{r sb-sample2, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.height=6}
plot2
```

- We're hoping that the sample (black) can say something meaningful about the population (white)

## Samples vs. populations

- *Population*: the complete set of units about which we intend to draw inferences
- *Sample*: the set of units that we are able to collect data about

We work with samples because it is almost never feasible to collect data about all units of interest.

We always evaluate our sampling design with reference to a population.

## Realizations vs. expectations

Let's say we're interested in the mean household carbon footprint in Santa Barbara:

```{r mean-compare}
mean(pop$tco2e) # actual mean
mean(pop[sam,"tco2e"]) # sample mean
```

Why do these quantities differ?

## Realizations vs. expectations

- Even when we draw a true representative sample, we can expect variation in the sample value across repeated draws.
  + The uncertainty created by *sampling variation* influences the degree to which we can be certain about our conclusions.
  + We typically want to choose sample sizes to keep sampling variation managable, given inferential goals.
  
- When you hear a polling result with a stated *margin of error*, that error is many comprised of expected sampling variation.

- Let's see:

## Sampling distribution

- **Sampling distribution**: the distribution of sample values with a repeated draw of a given sampling frame.
- **Sampling frame**: this procedure describing the sample to be drawn.

```{r sam-dist, cache=TRUE}
sims <- 1000
store <- rep(NA, sims)

#each iteration indexed by i (1-sims). first empty value in store will be result for 1, then 2
for (i in 1:sims){
  store[i] <- mean(pop[sample(1:36000,2000),"tco2e"])
}

store

#se is sd of stand dev how much on avg when you draw sample you're going to be off. sd is descirption of data. se is descrption of sampling distribution

```

##Sampling distribution

```{r plot-sam, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.height=3.5, warning=FALSE}
sam.dist <- ggplot(data.frame(store), aes(x=store)) + 
  geom_histogram(color="black", fill="white") +
  xlab("Mean value of sample") + xlim(c(57,68)) +
  annotate("text",-Inf,Inf,label="n=2000", hjust = 0, vjust = 1)
sam.dist
```

```{r sam-summary}
mean(store) #expected sample mean
sd(store) #standard error
```

## Standard deviation vs. standard error

```{r sd-vs-se}
sd(pop[sam,"tco2e"]) #standard deviation of sample
sd(store) #standard error of sample
```

- *Standard deviation* of a sample describes the variance in the data ($\sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \bar{y})^2}$)
- *Standard error* of a sample describes the expected sampling variance based on the sampling frame over repeated draws

## Standard error and sample size

```{r increase-sam, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE, fig.height=6, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
sims <- 1000
store2 <- rep(NA, sims)
for (i in 1:sims){
  store2[i] <- mean(pop[sample(1:36000,4000),"tco2e"])
}

sam.dist2 <- ggplot(data.frame(store2), aes(x=store2)) + 
  geom_histogram(color="black", fill="white") +
  xlab("Mean value of sample") + xlim(c(57,68)) +
  annotate("text",-Inf,Inf,label="n=4000", hjust = 0, vjust = 1)

grid.arrange(sam.dist,sam.dist2,ncol=1)
```


## Standard error and sample size

```{r samp-dist-many, cache=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
samps <- seq(from=250, to=10000, by=250)
sims <- 1000
store <- rep(NA, sims)
se.store <- rep(NA, length(samps))

for (j in 1:length(samps)){

for (i in 1:sims){
  store[i] <- mean(pop[sample(1:36000,samps[j]),"tco2e"])
}
  
se.store[j] <- sd(store)

}

dta <- data.frame(samps,se.store) %>% mutate(before=ifelse((samps==2000 | samps==4000),1,0))

ggplot(dta, aes(x=samps,y=se.store,color=before)) + geom_point(size=4) + xlab("Sample Size") + ylab("Standard Error of Sample") + theme(legend.position = "none")

```

## Sampling bias

So far we've assumed that we can take a random ("representative") sample from the population and then examined the properties of those samples. In practice, it is often  difficult to take a random sample from our target population, which leads to sampling bias.

- **Sampling bias** is the difference between the true value of the population parameter we are trying to discover and the *expected value* of that parameter based on the sampling procedure.
    + Sampling bias is **not** the difference between the true value of the population parameter and the realized value in a sample.
    + Sampling procedures that deviate from a random sample cause sampling bias.
  
- There are two main sources of sampling bias we will discuss:
    + Population / sample mismatches
    + Reporting bias


## Population / Sample Mismatches

- This occurs when your sampling frame does not match your target population. Some examples:

Population      Sample        
--------        -------------- 
Likely voters   Voters with landline telephones              
Water users     Single family households           
Households      Households on main road
Fishers         Commercial fishers who use certain port
---------       --------------   

- This matters when the outcome covaries with sample frame exclusion criteria


## Mismatches: An Example

![Main road bias](main_road.png)

## Declaring a population: an example

```{r declare-main_road}
set.seed(228)

#create new columns, half 1 half 0 for "main" road. rho is correlation between main road and satisfaction (50% of satisfsction explained by whether or not live on main road)

#add 500 households. Create indicator for whether or not they're on the main street. Half are not on the street (repeate 0 250 times) and half are on the street (repeat 1 250 times)

#level of satisfaction is higher on the main road. There is a positive correlation between leaving on the main road and whether or not you're satisfied. Draw binary outcome (1,0 satisfied) Overall probabilty of being satisfied is 50%

population <- declare_population(
  households = add_level(N=500, 
     main=draw_binary(N=N, prob = 0.5),
     satisfied=correlate(given = main, rho = 0.5,
                         draw_binary, prob = 0.5)
))
pop <- population()

#make a table with headers
kable(table(pop$main,pop$satisfied)) %>% 
  add_header_above(c("main"=1,"satisfied"=2))

```

## Consequences of sampling procedures

```{r conseq}
mean(pop$satisfied) #target population parameter
mean(pop %>% filter(main==1) %>% pull(satisfied))
```

The difference between these two values is **bias**, not sampling variability.

- Look for any part of the population systematically excluded from the sample.
- Change interpretation to match sample actually drawn.


## Population / Sample Mismatches

- Some examples:

Population      Sample        
--------        -------------- 
Likely voters   Voters with landline telephones              
Water users     Single family households           
Households      Households on main road
Fishers         Commercial fishers who use certain port
---------       --------------   


## Response bias

**Response bias** is the difference between the true parameter of interest and the expected sample value of the parameter based on unequal probabilities of reporting.

- Often times harder to address than sample-population mismatches
- Can create large errors in measurement if not managed carefully

Let's continue with the previous example and assume:

1. We now take a random sample of all households by knocking on doors
2. If you live on the main street the chance that you are home is 50%
3. If you live on the side street the chance that you are home is 20%

## Declaring response bias

```{r diff-reporting, size="small"}
# chance of reporting if you have a 1 or a 0 
reporting <- declare_assignment(blocks=main,
                  assignment_variable = "R",
                  block_prob=c(0.2,0.5)) 
pop <- reporting(pop)
kable(pop[1:6,])
```

## Declaring response bias

```{r resp-tab}
table(pop$main,pop$R)
```

## Examining sample characteristics

```{r samp-character}

sims <- 1000 #take 1000 simulations
sam.n <- 250 # take a sample size of 250 each time

#create an object to store our values (called store)
#figure out the mean value for units on main street (main)
#use data for reporting
#pull out outcome and take the mean of it

for (i in 1:sims){
  index <- sample(1:500),sam.n)
pop <- reporting(pop)
main<-mean(pop[index] %>% 
  filter(R==1 & main ==1) %>% 
  pull(satisfied))
side <- mean(pop[index,] %>% 
               filter(R==1 & main ==0) %>% 
               pull(satisfied))
store[i] <-main*0.5 + side*0.5))
}

store <- rep(NA, sims)
for (i in 1:sims){
  store[i] <- mean(pop[sample(1:500,sam.n),] %>%
                     filter(R==1) %>%
                     pull(satisfied))
}

summary(store)

```

## Response bias visualization

```{r resp-viz, echo=FALSE}
sam.dist <- ggplot(data.frame(store), aes(x=store)) + 
  geom_histogram(color="black", fill="white") +
  xlab("Mean value of sample") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean(pop$satisfied), linetype="dashed", 
                color = "blue", size=1.5)
sam.dist
```

## Common sources of response bias

- Difficulty of reaching certain groups given a sampling procedure
- Convenience samples
- Differential interest in participating
- Different times of availability

Remember both population-sample mismatches and sampling bias can be relevant at the same time


## DeclareDesign()

A flexible framework for making declarations about our population, samples, and diagnosing bias. Let's do what we just did entirely within the DeclareDesign() framework:

```{r declare-pop}
population <- declare_population(
  households = add_level(N=500, 
     main=draw_binary(N=N, prob = 0.5),
     satisfied=correlate(given = main, rho = 0.5,
                         draw_binary, prob = 0.5)
))
```

## DeclareDesign()

```{r declare-report}
reporting <- declare_assignment(blocks=main,
                  assignment_variable = "R",
                  block_prob=c(0.2,0.5))

sampling <- declare_sampling(n=250)

#parameter of interest that is the true alue (unknowabel bute we want toa ccurately represent gien our sample and procedure)
my_estimand <- declare_estimands(mean(satisfied),
                                 label = "Ybar")

answer <- declare_estimator(satisfied ~ 1,
                            subset = (R==1),
                            model = lm_robust,
                            label = "est.")

```

#coverage - how much does the sampling distrbituion cover the estiamte (???)

## DeclareDesign()

```{r diagnosis}
design <- population + reporting + sampling + 
  my_estimand + answer
diagnosis <- diagnose_design(design)

diagnosis$diagnosands_df[,c(5,11,13,15)] %>%
  kable()

```
